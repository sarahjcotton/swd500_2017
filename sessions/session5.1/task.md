 -  Download the following zip file from [here](https://github.com/joeappleton18/swd500_2017/raw/master/sessions/session5.1/scssPractical.zip) and save it on your u drive

-  Notice how main.scss currently just has normal css in it. Sass is just an extension of css so this is fine. 

- This template is somewhat old fashioned, so we're going to progressively enhance it using sass. 


- Use a [SASS style guide](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) and the [notes](notes.md) to create a modern well structures set of sass files. 

- You should assume that further pages will be made
